# Message from Code Crafters

This is a starting point for Go solutions to the
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

_Add a description of your course here_

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

## This is my first ever shell built from scratch!

Keeping on with the trend of building items from scratch, I have built a shell by myself with the guidance of Code Crafters!
The course explained the fundamentals of instructions and what they're actually looking to accomplish.

I was able to integrate different package libraries into my code for one of the first times like os and filepath which have both been instrumental to completing the challenges within this course!

Please note that I completed this course during its beta testing phase, so there is a chance that there are things that either the Code Crafters tests haven't caught or that I haven't realised.

Either way, 5/31/2024 is the day this was completed and a great way to round out the month!
